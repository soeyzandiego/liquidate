# Liquidate

<b>ART ASSETS DO NOT BELONG TO ME</b>

Made for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/pre-made-jam-4">Pre-Made Jam #4</a> (Theme: "Liquid")

The company has gone under and you must liquidate your assets. Correctly distribute you assets in a timely manner, otherwise you'll find yourself in some legal trouble!

<b>[How to Play]</b>
  - Investors will make their way to the floor, requesting assets.
  - Click on assets in the top left to order assets, it will take a few moments for it to get to the floor.
  - Click and hold to drag assets to investors. If you give them the incorrect item, or don't give it quickly enough, they'll leave and you'll lose health.
  - You may only have 5 assets ordered at a time; if you need to get rid of any, drag it to the red arrow in the top left
